Below is the revised Product Requirements Document (PRD) integrating your preference for a SvelteKit front-end and a Python back-end. This approach can help minimize dependency conflicts and streamline development while still meeting all functional and non-functional requirements from the previous scope.

1. Project Overview
1.1 Purpose
Build a modern, responsive, SEO-optimized website for EriEthio Research that:
Captures leads and drives sales.
Educates visitors on AI topics, news, and best practices.
Provides 24/7 support and communication channels.
Automatically updates with new content (blog posts, research papers, AI news).
Remains cost-effective using open-source or free/low-cost solutions.
1.2 Goals & Objectives
Implement CI/CD so that new product releases, research papers, blog articles, or news trigger automated updates.
Ensure mobile responsiveness across all devices.
Leverage cost-effective hosting (Vercel, if suitable for SvelteKit deployment) and an in-house advanced CMS built on open-source frameworks.
Adopt SvelteKit for a more lightweight front-end and Python for the back-end to reduce dependency complexity.
Maintain a modular, scalable architecture for easy expansion.

6. Technical Considerations
Technology Stack


Front-End: SvelteKit for a more lightweight approach than React.
Back-End: Python framework (e.g., FastAPI or Flask).
Database:
SQLAlchemy with SQLite/Postgres, or
Google Sheets / Supabase for simpler usage.
Hosting:
Vercel for the SvelteKit front-end (check if Python backend can be integrated via serverless functions or separate hosting).
Alternatively, host Python API on a free tier (e.g., Heroku, Fly.io) if Vercel doesn’t meet your Python needs.
CI/CD Pipeline


Git-based workflow: push changes → build & test → auto-deploy.
Automatic site refresh upon new content from the CMS (webhooks or scheduled tasks).
Cost-Saving Integrations


Open-source chatbots (e.g., Rasa) or free-tier SaaS solutions.
Free email marketing (e.g., Mailchimp free tier) for small lists, or custom SMTP with free providers.

7. Implementation Roadmap
Phase 1: Discovery & Planning


Confirm wireframes with navigation, hero, footer.
Choose DB solution (Google Sheets vs. Supabase vs. SQLite/Postgres).
Define hosting approach for Python back-end (serverless or separate).
Phase 2: Core Development


Build SvelteKit front-end with placeholders for animations and modular components.
Develop Python back-end (Flask/FastAPI) for the CMS logic, APIs, and DB connections.
Integrate chosen DB solution, ensuring basic CRUD operations for content.
Phase 3: CI/CD Setup & Testing


Configure Git repository with auto-deploy to Vercel for the SvelteKit front-end.
Host or deploy Python back-end (Heroku, Fly.io, etc.) with an automated pipeline.
Validate performance, SEO, accessibility, and cross-browser compatibility.
Phase 4: Launch & Initial Content


Migrate existing blog articles, research papers, AI news aggregator.
Go live, test real-time content updates from the CMS to the front-end.
Phase 5: Post-Launch Optimization


Monitor analytics for lead conversions, bounce rates, page load times.
Gather user feedback, refine UI/UX.
Add features like advanced AI news aggregator, premium user accounts, or community forums.

8. Success Metrics
Lead Generation: Number of new signups, form completions, demo requests.
Automation Efficiency: Frequency of successful auto-updates from the CMS to the live site.
User Engagement: Time on site, returning visitors, blog post shares.
Mobile Responsiveness: Percentage of mobile traffic, bounce rate on mobile devices.
Cost Management: Hosting bills, free-tier usage, minimal overhead.
SEO Rankings: Improvement in targeted AI-related keywords, domain authority growth over time.

9. Risks & Mitigation
SvelteKit & Python Integration


Mitigation: Clearly separate front-end and back-end with a REST/GraphQL API. Confirm hosting compatibility (Vercel for front-end, separate for Python if needed).
In-House CMS Complexity


Mitigation: Start with essential features. Gradually add advanced modules (versioning, scheduling, etc.).
Database Scalability


Mitigation: If Google Sheets or SQLite become insufficient, migrate to Postgres or Supabase with minimal refactoring.
Budget Constraints


Mitigation: Strictly rely on free-tier hosting, open-source libraries, and simple DB solutions. Monitor usage monthly.
CI/CD Failures


Mitigation: Implement robust test suites and rollback mechanisms. Keep thorough documentation on deployment processes.

Conclusion
This updated PRD outlines a SvelteKit + Python stack for EriEthio Research’s new website, focusing on reduced dependency conflicts, cost-effectiveness, and seamless CI/CD. By following these guidelines, you’ll deliver a feature-rich, modular, and secure platform that automatically updates content, supports lead capture and user engagement, and scales efficiently with minimal overhead.
